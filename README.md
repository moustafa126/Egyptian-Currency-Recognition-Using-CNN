# Egyptian Currency Recognition Using CNN
•Developed a computer vision project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize and classify
different Egyptian currencies, including 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 pounds.
•Applied data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data.
•Utilized CNN architecture to train a model for currency recognition.
